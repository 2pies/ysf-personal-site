Both letters and numbers are an important part of our language, and are meaningless on its own unless we, as a society, attach meaning of hierarchy to them. If we take \"je\" (French) away like in Perec's work, we take ourselves away. If we take certain numbers away, we are left of an incomplete self, history and for some people, the financial purpose which they devote their lives to. Numbers is a symbol of power. As Foucault illustrates in his Panopticon Theory, power is decentralized and we become observers of ourselves, which means that the source of power is no longer a stable concept. With whips (plus various objects) and numerical algorithms, the audience will experience the meaning of numbers as a symbol of power which is unstable and arbitrary.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Disclaimer: If you enter this space, you risk being beaten and may have the opportunity to beat the environment around you, our performers and the audience.
